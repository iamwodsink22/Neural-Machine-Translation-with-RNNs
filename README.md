# Neural-Machine-Translation-with-RNNs
English-Spanish translation based using Bidirectional GRU implemented in Tensorflow.
You can continue training from either the checkpoints or "RNNFinal.keras" complete saved model. Either ways be sure to train for at least 10 more epochs. Create changes on 'translator' function to reverse the translation language from english-spanish to spanish-english or vice-versa.
